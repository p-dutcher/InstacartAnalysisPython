# Instacart Analysis using Python
### Utilizing Python, I conduct an analysis of Instacart data in order to provide meaningful insight into customer data and shopping habits. Attached are Jupyter Workbooks, as well as a final report with visualizations and recommendations.

## Background:
#### Instacart is an app-based grocery delivery service. While they are already very successful, they are seeking to uncover additional information about sales and customers to develop greater and more effective marketing strategies. 

## Key Questions:
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?	
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?			
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## Data and Tools:
#### The data set was provided by Instacart and has been analyzed with Python. All visualizations in the final presentation were created with Python as well.

## Project Deliverables:
